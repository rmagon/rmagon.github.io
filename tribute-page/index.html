  <p>"I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her]. Will he [she] gain anything by it? Will it restore him [her] to a control over his [her] own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?
Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away."
<em>- One of the last notes left behind by Gandhi in 1948, expressing his deepest social thought.</em></p>

  <h3>Mahatma Gandhi Qoutations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Nonviolence and cowardice go ill together. True nonviolence is an impossibility without the possession of unadulterated fearlessness.</li>
    <li>I refuse to buy from anybody anything, however nice or beautiful, if it interferes with my growth or injures those whom Nature has made my first care.</li>
    <li>I do regard spinning and weaving as a necessary part of any national system of education.</li>
    <li>If one does not practice nonviolence in oneâ€™s own personal relations with others and hopes to use it in bigger affairs, one is vastly mistaken.</li>
  </ul>
